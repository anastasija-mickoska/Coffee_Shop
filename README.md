This project is a mobile Android application developed in Java about an online coffee shop. The app enables users to browse the full menu and view detailed information about each product. Users can add items to a shopping cart and complete their purchase by filling out an order form during checkout. The application is structured using Android components such as Activities, Fragments, and Intents to provide smooth navigation and interaction. SQLite is used for data persistence, ensuring reliable storage of products and orders.
